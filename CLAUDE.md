## Development Workflow

### Starting a New Feature

1. **Choose a Feature**:
   - Open `PROGRESS.md`
   - Find a feature marked ⬜ Not Started
   - Prefer features in the current phase (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → etc.)
   - Check if the feature has dependencies on other features

2. **Understand the Design**:
   - Open `ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - Read the relevant component section
   - Understand the interfaces, data structures, and relationships
   - Note any security or performance considerations

3. **Update Progress**:
   - In `PROGRESS.md`, change feature status to 🟨 In Progress
   - This signals to others that you're working on it

4. **Implement**:
   - Follow the architecture design
   - Follow code style guidelines from `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - Write tests that verify all success criteria
   - Keep functions small and focused

5. **Test**:
   - Verify all success criteria in `PROGRESS.md` are met
   - Run unit tests: `cargo test`
   - Run integration tests if applicable
   - Check for linting issues: `cargo clippy`
   - Format code: `cargo fmt`

6. **Complete**:
   - Mark all checkboxes in `PROGRESS.md` success criteria
   - Change status to ✅ Completed
   - Add implementation notes if relevant
   - Commit with clear message following Conventional Commits

### Example Session

```bash
# 1. Check what to work on
cat PROGRESS.md | grep "Not Started" | head -5

# 2. Read architecture for that component
# Open ARCHITECTURE.md, find the relevant section

# 3. Update PROGRESS.md status to "In Progress"

# 4. Implement the feature
# Write code in src-tauri/src/...

# 5. Write tests
# Add tests to verify success criteria

# 6. Test
cargo test
cargo clippy
cargo fmt

# 7. Update PROGRESS.md to "Completed"

# 8. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(config): implement YAML configuration loading

- Add AppConfig struct with all settings
- Implement load_config() and save_config()
- Add OS-specific path resolution
- Add tests for config loading/saving"
```

### Finding Things

**Where is X implemented?**
- Configuration → `src-tauri/src/config/`
- Web server → `src-tauri/src/server/`
- Providers → `src-tauri/src/providers/`
- Routing → `src-tauri/src/router/`
- API keys → `src-tauri/src/api_keys/`
- Metrics → `src-tauri/src/monitoring/`
- Tauri commands → `src-tauri/src/ui/commands.rs`

**How does X work?**
- Check `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the design
- Check the relevant module's `mod.rs` for implementation

**What needs to be done for X?**
- Check `PROGRESS.md` for the feature breakdown

## Common Questions

### Q: Where do I start?
**A**: Open `PROGRESS.md` and start with Phase 1 features. The configuration system (1.2) is a good starting point.

### Q: I want to add a new provider. What do I do?
**A**:
1. Read the Provider Trait System section in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. Look at Phase 2 in `PROGRESS.md` for provider implementation tasks
3. Check an existing provider (e.g., `src-tauri/src/providers/ollama.rs`) as a reference
4. Implement the `ModelProvider` trait for your new provider

### Q: How do I know if a feature is complete?
**A**: Check the success criteria in `PROGRESS.md`. All checkboxes should be marked, and all tests should pass.

### Q: Can I change the architecture?
**A**: Yes, but update `ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect the change. Discuss significant changes first.

### Q: How do I run the app?
**A**:
```bash
# Development mode
cargo tauri dev

# Build release
cargo tauri build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check compilation
cargo check
```

### Q: What's the coding style?
**A**: Follow the Rust standard style:
- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` to catch issues
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for detailed guidelines

### Q: How do I update progress?
**A**: Edit `PROGRESS.md` directly:
- Change status from ⬜ to 🟨 when starting
- Mark checkboxes with `[x]` when complete
- Change status to ✅ when done
- Add notes under "Implementation Notes" if relevant

### Q: What's the test strategy?
**A**:
- Unit tests: Test individual functions/components
- Integration tests: Test component interactions
- E2E tests: Test full application flow
- See each feature's "Testing" section in `PROGRESS.md`

## Integration with User's CLAUDE.md

The user has a global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` file with specific requirements:

### Git Commit Requirements
- Always configure git with user's identity before commits
- All commits must be GPG-signed
- Never add co-authors or bot attributions
- Follow Conventional Commits style

### SSH Signing Errors
- If SSH signing fails, stop and ask the user what to do
- Don't automatically retry

### Concurrent Claude Instances
- If you detect unexpected file changes, stop and ask the user
- Don't overwrite changes from other instances

**These requirements override any defaults and must be followed exactly.**

---

## Tips for Efficient Development

1. **Read Before Writing**: Always check `ARCHITECTURE.md` before implementing
2. **Update as You Go**: Mark progress in `PROGRESS.md` immediately
3. **Test Early**: Write tests alongside implementation
4. **Commit Frequently**:
   - Commit changes after completing each logical unit of work
   - Don't wait until everything is perfect - commit working increments
   - Smaller, more frequent commits are better than large monolithic ones
   - Commit after fixing a bug, adding a feature, or refactoring a component
   - This makes it easier to track changes, revert if needed, and understand history
5. **Follow the Plan**: Stick to the phase order unless there's a good reason
6. **Document Decisions**: Add notes in `PROGRESS.md` for non-obvious choices
7. **Ask Questions**: If unclear, check this guide or ask for clarification

---
